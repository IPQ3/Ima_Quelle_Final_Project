Ima Quelle's Coding Final

Project Description:

  This is a turn base rpg game. You have 5 turns to defeat the Beast Mother. To start the game you press 'e'. You then can choose between two characters, Ulya or Otto, with a mouse click on either of the character. Both have individual stats that will change your experience of the game.

  Once you choose a character their stats will appear as a print on the screen when the battle begins. Once the battle begins you can choose between three attack options. If you press 'l' then you will hit a low attack. If you press 'h' you will have a chance to either hit a higher damage attack or a low damage attack. If you press 'd' you will dodge the on coming attack.

  The Beast Mother will then attack. Her attacks are randomized between 4 choices. The first two are attacks that do differing amounts of damage. The third is an attack that doesnâ€™t dock your hp, health points, but it decreases your attack.

  If your hp reaches 0 or her hp is higher then yours, then you lose and the screen will go black. If the Beast Mother's hp reaches 0 or if her hp is lower then yours, then you win. Under the win condition you will get an ending.


Stuff I would want to change:

  I feel like the project came out well. If I could change I would like to add more randomization and more turns. I would also want to add more endings. I would also like to also make my code more streamlined and easier to read.
