Ima Quelle's Coding Final

  This is a turn base rpg game. You have 5 turns to defeat the Beast Mother. You can choose between two characters, Ulya or Otto, with a mouse click on either of the character. Both have individual stats that will change your experience of the game. 
  
  Once you choose a character their stats will appear as a print on the screen when the battle begins. Once the battle begins you can choose between three attack options. If you press 'l' then you will hit a low attack. If you press 'h' you will have a chance to either hit a higher damage attack or a low damage attack. If you press 'd' you will doge the on coming attack.
  
  The Beast Mother will then attack. Her attacks are randomised between 4 choices. The first two are attacks that do differeing amounts of damage. The third is an attack that doesnt dock your hp, health points, but it decreases your attack.
  
  If your hp reaches 0 or her hp is higher then yours, then you lose and the screen will go black. If the Beast Mother's hp reaches 0 or if her hp is lower then yours, then you win. Under the win condition you will get an ending.
